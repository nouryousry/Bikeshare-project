I have searched pandas documentation as well asstackflow in order to obtain some answers, particularly, in knowing about nlargest().

Links used:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.nlargest.html#pandas.Series.nlargest
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32589829/how-to-get-value-counts-for-multiple-columns-at-once-in-pandas-dataframe

This is in addition to looking through the material and links embedded in it.
