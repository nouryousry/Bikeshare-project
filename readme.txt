This project was part of Udacity nanodegree. 
The data used was that of bike share systems in major cities in the United States: New york city, Chicago and Washignton.
The goal was to explore this data using Python along with two of its libraries- numpy and pandas. In addition, descriptive statistics were computed and an interactive experience was provided for the users by letting them define filters to output specific statistics.
